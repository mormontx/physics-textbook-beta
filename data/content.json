Mass is a measure of an object's inertia.</p>\n\n<h2>Newton's Second Law - Force and Acceleration</h2>\n<p>The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass:</p>\n\n<div class=\"equation-block\">\n    $$\\\\vec{F}_{net} = m\\\\vec{a}$$\n</div>\n\n<p>This is arguably the most important equation in classical mechanics. It tells us that force causes acceleration, and more massive objects require more force to achieve the same acceleration.</p>\n\n<h2>Newton's Third Law - Action and Reaction</h2>\n<div class=\"callout callout-important\">\n    <div class=\"callout-title\">The Law</div>\n    <p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>More precisely: If object A exerts a force on object B, then object B exerts an equal and opposite force on object A:</p>\n\n<div class=\"equation-block\">\n    $$\\\\vec{F}_{AB} = -\\\\vec{F}_{BA}$$\n</div>\n\n<h2>Momentum</h2>\n<p>Momentum is defined as mass times velocity:</p>\n\n<div class=\"equation-block\">\n    $$\\\\vec{p} = m\\\\vec{v}$$\n</div>\n\n<p>The law of conservation of momentum states that in an isolated system, the total momentum remains constant.</p>"
